  I'm an aspiring programmer and level designer. I've worked on a few basic
  projects and games. I've always enjoy video games and how they challenge your
  ability to think on the fly and how well you can physical react to a
  situation. I've also always loved the story telling and how it can create a
  world that you want to keep playing in. I've always wanted to create that
  feeling for another person with story telling and good game play. Below are a
  few project that i have worked on to get a feel for programming.

One of the larger project i worked on ,in Visual Studio with Mono Game, was called Featherfell. It was a block pushing puzzle game that i had worked on. This game was a large experiment as i had not worked with any kind of 2d collision. The game was a huge challenge to work with as i had to have multiple objects that needed to be pushed, but could not move through each other. I also needed to allow the player to push the objects, but not if it was against another one facing the same direction. I t was a huge challenge and though it still didn't work perfectly it helped me understand more about programming.
